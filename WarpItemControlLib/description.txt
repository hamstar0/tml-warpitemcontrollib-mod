Warp Item Control Lib allows controlling the use of player warp items (Magic Mirrors, Cellphones, Recall Potions, etc.), including:

 - Adjusting time until warp items activate.
 - Disabling warp items completely, or on demand (via. API).
 - Using a debuff (Chaos State) to limit or punish overuse of warp items.

Configurable.
