# Cursed Brambles

Cursed brambles now generate around you in your wake, while underground. They also generate in the wake of bosses.

On contact, cursed brambles slow your movement like cobwebs, but also inflict venom and are not affected by attacks. They will either dissipate on their own in time, or require manual pickaxing to be removed.
